## 📐 Built with Bootstrap

This project makes full use of Bootstrap 5's features to ensure responsiveness, visual consistency, and ease of development:

### 🧱 Layout

- Structured using Bootstrap’s **grid system** (`container`, `row`, `col`) for responsive and scalable page layout.
- **Flexbox utilities** used to align and distribute task elements dynamically.

### 🧩 Components & Utilities

- **Form elements**: Bootstrap’s `form-control`, `input-group`, and validation classes used for input styling.
- **Buttons**: Styled using `btn`, `btn-primary`, and `btn-outline-*` classes for interactive actions.
- **Cards**: Used for grouping task items visually with shadows and padding (`card`, `shadow`, `p-3`).
- **Utilities**: Bootstrap spacing (`mt-3`, `mb-2`, `px-4`), borders (`rounded`), and text helpers (`text-center`, `fw-bold`) to maintain a polished appearance.

### 📱 Responsiveness

- Fully mobile-first and responsive without writing custom media queries.
- Layout adapts fluidly across phones, tablets, and desktops using Bootstrap’s grid and flex utilities.
